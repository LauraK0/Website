  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2><br>
  <h3><em>Who am I?</em></h3>
  <p>
    Currently I am an architect working in a studio in central London, a studio which focuses primarily on commercial architecture.
    Most recently I have been project lead on a commercial refurbishment and extension project in West Kensington. 
    Originally built as a Victorian furniture depository, the aim of the project was to refurbish the historically significant building to meet the demands of the modern office occupier, make significant upgrades to the environmental credentials of the building.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3><em>Why the career change?</em></h3>
  <p>
  Since beginning my architectural studies, my primary goal was to become a Project Architect and have been able to lead many projects over the previous few years. 
  During this time I developed a keen interest in Dynamo, a visual programming language, to take advantage of automation to generate the required production information. 
  For example, I created a script that automatically reordered and formatted the window type mark with the correct information when creating the Window Schedule, avoiding the need to manually renumber thousands of windows. 
  I began to realise that I enjoyed the process of creating these simple scripts more than I enjoyed creating buildings.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p> I studied at the Glasgow School of Art and developed a keen interest in contextural and sustainable architecture and moved to London to pursue my career.
    I am also interested in art and design and keen to get out to exhibitions/ visit different parts of London in my spare time.
    I also enjoy sport and keeping active, playing in a local hockey team.
