      <h3><em>Who am I?</em></h3>
      <p>
          I am an architect working in a studio in central London, in a studio which focuses primarily on commercial architecture.
          Most recently I have been project lead on a commercial refurbishment and extension project in West Kensington. 
          I was originally drawn to architecture as it seemed to offer the perfect balance of creativity with problem solving.

        <h3><em>Why the career change?</em></h3>
        <p>
          Early on in my career I discovered coding through using a visual programming language to automate the production of construction information. 
          I began to realise that I enjoyed the process of creating these simple scripts more than I enjoyed creating buildings.
          From then on, the more I've learned about programming, the more I enjoyed it.

        <h3><em>Why Founders and Coders?</em></h3>
        <p> 
          After researching many coding bootcamps, I believe Founders and Coders offer the most well rounded experience.  
          Not only would I be able to develop my coding knowledge but also gain an understanding of what employers are looking for.
          Additionally, in my current role, I see the benefits of collaboration when solving creative problems and so the community's focus on peer-led education appealled to me greatly.
